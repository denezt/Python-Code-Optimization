	<h2>Benchmarking</h2>
	<p>Benchmarking code enables a programmer to refactor code and minimize or eliminate "Bottlenecking". <br> 
	Refactoring code is important for systems with limited memory and or share resources. <br/>
	Additionally, the previous code might require change due to application enhancement or upgrades.<br/> 
	In such cases code benchmarking can assist the developer in measuring processor cycles and computation time. <br/>
